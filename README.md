A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

* `countLetters(sentence)`: function takes in a string, and outputs an object that lists how many times each letter was used (not case sensitive). Only unaccented letters will be counted and returned in the output.
* `function2(...)`: description
* `function3(...)`: description
